> #### Word of advice 
> More importantly than learning everything or loading your Vim with ever more plugins is getting advice on how to work with it efficiently. One of my first steps to learn the basics was the Vimtutor, which taught me within an hour or so, how to open/save a file, copy/paste, search/replace, or how to navigate. I personally use Tmux to create windows and splits, use Vim netrw to open files in new tabs, rename or delete them, use manual folding for easy scrolling in my large files (with a trick in my '.vimrc' configuration file, so that they are stored after closing). I have syntax highlighting and syntax checking for different file types, as well as intellisense and word completion. In order to compare or merge files or versions I usually use Vimdiff or kdiff3. And to step through my code I use a debugger like pdb or bashdb.

### 📜 Instructions on how to use .vim and .vimrc
>
> Please click the button below. The steps show, how to install and run Vim. It's easy, just a few clicks and you can start writing your Python, Java or Bash Code in your new IDE.  
>
> <details>
> <summary> 📖  show the instructions </summary>
>
> 📜
>   
>    * In case you would like to install some additional software, like Shellcheck or Powerline from your software center, in Linux Ubuntu just type:  
>         $ sudo apt install powerline  
>         $ sudo apt install shellcheck  
>
>    * Open Vim on Linux Ubuntu with:  
>         $ vim  
>    
>    * The only plugin I left in my '.vim' folder is the plugin manager. In order to download the needed plugins, just type:  
>         :PlugInstall    
>    
>    * Now you can open an existing file or create a new one in a new tab in Vim.  
>         :tabnew filename  
>    
>    * That's it! To save the file just type:  
>         :w  
>
> * In order to get the promised explanations about the [content of my '.vimrc' file][1503] you may later want to visit my wiki page. (Ctrl-click to open the link in a new tab)

### 🌎 Links
> To share the links of web pages, which present their content in a clear and easy to read manner is one of the main objectives of my repositories. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, because most of the time there are already excellent resources out there, where the reader can find the needed information. But often, even with the help of one's preferred search engine, one ends up spending one's time with searching instead of working.  
> By clicking the button below you will see the links of my top &&& sites for &&&. If you still struggle with the syntax, then you may consider &&& as described [here][&&&].

### 🗄️ qoolixiloop's repositories
>
> By clicking the button below you will see a table with links to my 15 Code and 15 Wiki repositories as well as a short description of what is already available. They cover a small subset of programming languages I learned during the last 20 or so years. The focus is mainly on free and open source tools within the linux operating system universe.  
> Because the learning curve for many of those tools and languages I used was steeper than necessary, I decided to provide some of my resources, references and examples, in order to help new learners better understand important topics.

> **Tmux and Vim as an IDE:** There are many good development environments availabe and some of them are quite expensive. Nevertheless or because of that, I mainly use Tmux and Vim as they are two very powerful terminal applications, which provide me with everything I need to write code efficiently. That being said, I must admit, that it is not easy to start with. That is why I shared my '.vim' folder and '.vimrc' configuration file, which both contain all the necessary instructions to download the plugins and run Vim within minutes as an IDE for example for Python, Java or Bash.  
>
> **Vim as a language:** Once I started programming with Vim, I immediately came into contact with Vim's own programming language, Vimscript. I even started to write my own little plugins and macros in Vimscript.  
>
> **Web Applications:** Google's Angular2 and the Springboot framework are part of the high demand trendy Java world. We used it at the University to build a multi-player online strategy game, which I intend to share as a tutorial. But that will certainly take some time.  
>
> **C**: Dennis Ritchie the father of Unix also developed C, which was in fact my first programming language. It is very low level compaired to newer languages, like Java or Python, many of which actually are implemented in C. It is clearly part of the low supply world, which means, that even though the language is still very useful for certain tasks, there are not many programmers left, that are able to understand it.  
>
> **Linux Tools:** Bash and AWK are old, but still very powerful languages in the Unix/Linux command line world and even though the Linux kernel itself is written in C, many configuration scripts one may come across are written in Bash.  
> There is already a lot of very good advice about Bash programming available in thick books as well as in form of snippets scattered around specialized blogs and webpages. But it is still hard to get started with. That is why I decided to create a small framework inside a template script, whose code itself is checked by the shellcheck project. The template e.g. contains a few instructions, which make use of a concept used in Python to run the script from within a main() function, which is useful if the script is sourced or executed within another script in order to access its functions.  
> Furthermore, I provided an extensive example script, in which I cover nearly everything one needs to write stable and reliable scripts. I actually use it, to automate my communication with GitHub. It also lets me do changes on all my GitHub files automatically by providing pattern search and replace, and it uses AWK to parse the script and to automatically print help and documentation text into the shell.
